Question:

        You are a military commander assistant. Your users are military commanders and your role is to help them develop military courses of action (COA).
        The military commanders will inform you the mission objective, terrain information, and available friendly and hostile assets before you start developing the COA.
        Given this information, you will develop a number of courses of action (as specified by the commander) so they can iterate on them with you and pick their favorite one.
        For each COA to be complete, every friendly unit needs to be assigned one command from the list below. Hostile units cannot be assigned any command.
        
        1) attack_move_unit(unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to move to target (x, y) coordinate in the map engaging hostile units in its path.
        2) engage_target_unit(unit_id, target_unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to engage with hostile target unit, which is located at the target (x, y) coordinate in the map. If out of range, friendly unit will move to the target unit location before engaging.
        
        Remember, it is of vital importance that all friendly units are given commands. All generated COAs should be aggregated in a single JSON object following the template below:

        additional_military_info:
        
        - The forms of maneuver are envelopment, flank attack, frontal attack, infiltration, penetration, and turning movement. Commanders use these forms of maneuver to orient on the enemy, not terrain.
        - The four primary offensive tasks are movement to contact, attack, exploitation, and pursuit. While it is convenient to talk of them as different tasks, in reality they flow readily from one to another.
        - There are three basic defensive tasks - area defense, mobile defense, and retrograde.

Question:

        I need to generate a single military course of action to accomplish the following mission objective:
        Move friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east via multiple bridges, destroy all hostile forces, and ultimately seize objective OBJ Lion East at the top right corner of the map (coordinates x: 200, y: 89).
        The mission is taking place in the following map/terrain:
        The map is split in two major portions (west and east sides) by a river that runs from north to south. There are four bridges that can be used to cross this river. Bridge names and exit coordinates are as follows: 1) Bridge Bobcat (x: 75, y: 26), 2) Bridge Wolf (x: 76, y: 128), 3) Bridge Bear (x:81, y: 179), and 4) Bridge Lion (x: 82, y: 211).
        The available Friendly and Hostile forces with their respective identification tags, types, and position are defined in the following JSON object:
        {'unit_id': 4295229441, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 82, 'y': 220}}, {'unit_id': 4295491585, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 238}}, {'unit_id': 4295753729, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 79, 'y': 219}}, {'unit_id': 4296015873, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 228}}, {'unit_id': 4297064449, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4297326593, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4297850881, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 226}}, {'unit_id': 4298113025, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 236}}, {'unit_id': 4299423745, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 32, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4300472321, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4300734465, 'unit_type': 'Mechanized Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 33, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4301258753, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 57, 'y': 234}}, {'unit_id': 4301520897, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 83, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4302045185, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 237}}, {'unit_id': 4302307329, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4301783041, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 25, 'y': 224}}, {'unit_id': 4300996609, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4300210177, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 80, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4299948033, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 34, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4299685889, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 84, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4299161601, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 40, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4298899457, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 78, 'y': 213}}, {'unit_id': 4298637313, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4298375169, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 86, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4297588737, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4296802305, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 229}}, {'unit_id': 4296540161, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 85, 'y': 220}}, {'unit_id': 4296278017, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4294967297, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 228}}
        
Answer:
Based on the given information, the military course of action to accomplish the mission objectives could be as follows:

1. Conduct reconnaissance:
   - Gather intelligence on enemy forces, their positions, and strength.

2. Formulate a plan:
   - Identify the most suitable bridge(s) to use for crossing the river based on distance, terrain conditions, and enemy presence.
   - Determine the order and timing of crossing each bridge to minimize exposure and maximize the element of surprise.
   - Consider establishing a diversionary attack or feint to draw enemy forces away from the main objective.

3. Secure Bridge Bobcat:
   - Deploy friendly forces to secure and defend Bridge Bobcat (x: 75, y: 26).
   - Eliminate any hostile forces in the vicinity.
   - Prepare bridge for crossing by ensuring it is intact and safe for use.

4. Cross the river:
   - Utilize Bridge Bobcat to move friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east side.
   - Maintain security during the crossing to protect against any potential enemy ambush or attack.

5. Secure Bridge Wolf:
   - Once across the river, deploy forces to secure and defend Bridge Wolf (x: 76, y: 128).
   - Neutralize any hostiles in the area.
   - Prepare bridge for crossing by ensuring it is intact and safe for use.

6. Cross the river:
   - Utilize Bridge Wolf to move friendly forces further east towards the objective.
   - Maintain security during the crossing.

7. Secure Bridge Bear:
   - Deploy forces to secure and defend Bridge Bear (x:81, y: 179).
   - Clear the area of any enemy presence.
   - Ensure the bridge is secure for crossing.

8. Cross the river:
   - Utilize Bridge Bear to continue moving friendly forces towards the objective.
   - Ensure security during the crossing.

9. Locate and neutralize hostile forces:
   - Conduct thorough searches and reconnaissance of the surrounding area to locate and neutralize any remaining hostiles.
   - Engage and destroy enemy forces to ensure the safety of friendly troops.

10. Seize objective OBJ Lion East:
    - Move friendly forces towards coordinates x: 200, y: 89 to secure objective OBJ Lion East.
    - Eliminate any remaining resistance in the area.
    - Establish a defensive position to maintain control of the objective.

11. Consolidate and maintain control:
    - Secure the area around objective OBJ Lion East to prevent enemy counterattacks or infiltration.
    - Establish communication and logistics lines to support ongoing operations.

12. Execute follow-on missions:
    - Upon successful completion of the primary mission objectives, assess the situation and plan subsequent missions as required by higher command.

It is important to note that the specific details of the military course of action may vary based on factors such as the size and capabilities of friendly and hostile forces, composition of mission assets, terrain conditions, enemy tactics, and the plan and orders provided by higher command.
