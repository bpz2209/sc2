Question:

        You are a military commander assistant. Your users are military commanders and your role is to help them develop military courses of action (COA).
        The military commanders will inform you the mission objective, terrain information, and available friendly and hostile assets before you start developing the COA.
        Given this information, you will develop a number of courses of action (as specified by the commander) so they can iterate on them with you and pick their favorite one.
        For each COA to be complete, every friendly unit needs to be assigned one command from the list below. Hostile units cannot be assigned any command.
        
        1) attack_move_unit(unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to move to target (x, y) coordinate in the map engaging hostile units in its path.
        2) engage_target_unit(unit_id, target_unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to engage with hostile target unit, which is located at the target (x, y) coordinate in the map. If out of range, friendly unit will move to the target unit location before engaging.
        
        Remember, it is of vital importance that all friendly units are given commands. All generated COAs should be aggregated in a single JSON object following the template below:

        additional_military_info:
        
        - The forms of maneuver are envelopment, flank attack, frontal attack, infiltration, penetration, and turning movement. Commanders use these forms of maneuver to orient on the enemy, not terrain.
        - The four primary offensive tasks are movement to contact, attack, exploitation, and pursuit. While it is convenient to talk of them as different tasks, in reality they flow readily from one to another.
        - There are three basic defensive tasks - area defense, mobile defense, and retrograde.

Question:

        I need to generate a single military course of action to accomplish the following mission objective:
        Move friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east via multiple bridges, destroy all hostile forces, and ultimately seize objective OBJ Lion East at the top right corner of the map (coordinates x: 200, y: 89).
        The mission is taking place in the following map/terrain:
        The map is split in two major portions (west and east sides) by a river that runs from north to south. There are four bridges that can be used to cross this river. Bridge names and exit coordinates are as follows: 1) Bridge Bobcat (x: 75, y: 26), 2) Bridge Wolf (x: 76, y: 128), 3) Bridge Bear (x:81, y: 179), and 4) Bridge Lion (x: 82, y: 211).
        The available Friendly and Hostile forces with their respective identification tags, types, and position are defined in the following JSON object:
        {'unit_id': 4294967297, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 228}}, {'unit_id': 4296015873, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 228}}, {'unit_id': 4296802305, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 229}}, {'unit_id': 4297326593, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4297588737, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4297850881, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 226}}, {'unit_id': 4298113025, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 236}}, {'unit_id': 4298637313, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4299161601, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 40, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4299423745, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 32, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4299685889, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 84, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4299948033, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 34, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4300996609, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4301783041, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 25, 'y': 224}}, {'unit_id': 4302307329, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4302045185, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 237}}, {'unit_id': 4301520897, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 83, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4301258753, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 57, 'y': 234}}, {'unit_id': 4300734465, 'unit_type': 'Mechanized Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 33, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4300472321, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4300210177, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 80, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4298899457, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 78, 'y': 213}}, {'unit_id': 4298375169, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 86, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4297064449, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4296540161, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 85, 'y': 220}}, {'unit_id': 4296278017, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4295753729, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 79, 'y': 219}}, {'unit_id': 4295491585, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 238}}, {'unit_id': 4295229441, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 82, 'y': 220}}
        
Answer:
To generate a single military course of action to accomplish the mission objective, the following steps can be taken:
1. Gather intelligence about the enemy forces and their positions.
2. Conduct reconnaissance to identify the most suitable bridge for the friendly forces to cross.
3. Secure the identified bridge and eliminate any hostile forces in the vicinity.
4. Deploy troops and equipment to the bridge to establish a secure crossing point.
5. Divide the friendly forces into smaller groups and assign them to different bridges to cross simultaneously.
6. Provide air and artillery support to suppress and neutralize enemy forces along the river.
7. Monitor and defend the bridges to ensure safe passage for the friendly forces.
8. Coordinate with friendly forces on the east side of the river to secure their positions and provide reinforcement if needed.
9. Utilize the advantage of surprise and coordinate a swift and simultaneous assault on OBJ Lion East.
10. Maintain communication and coordination between all friendly forces to ensure a synchronized attack on the objective.
11. Deploy additional forces, if necessary, to reinforce the assault on OBJ Lion East.
12. Neutralize any remaining enemy forces in the vicinity and secure objective OBJ Lion East.

By following these steps, the friendly forces can successfully move from the west side of the river to the east, eliminate all hostile forces, and ultimately seize objective OBJ Lion East at the top right corner of the map.
