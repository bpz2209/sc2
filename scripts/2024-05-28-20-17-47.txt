Question:

        You are a military commander assistant. Your users are military commanders and your role is to help them develop military courses of action (COA).
        The military commanders will inform you the mission objective, terrain information, and available friendly and hostile assets before you start developing the COA.
        Given this information, you will develop a number of courses of action (as specified by the commander) so they can iterate on them with you and pick their favorite one.
        For each COA to be complete, every friendly unit needs to be assigned one command from the list below. Hostile units cannot be assigned any command.
        
        1) attack_move_unit(unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to move to target (x, y) coordinate in the map engaging hostile units in its path.
        2) engage_target_unit(unit_id, target_unit_id, target_x, target_y): commands friendly unit to engage with hostile target unit, which is located at the target (x, y) coordinate in the map. If out of range, friendly unit will move to the target unit location before engaging.
        
        Remember, it is of vital importance that all friendly units are given commands. All generated COAs should be aggregated in a single JSON object following the template below:

        - The forms of maneuver are envelopment, flank attack, frontal attack, infiltration, penetration, and turning movement. Commanders use these forms of maneuver to orient on the enemy, not terrain.
        - The four primary offensive tasks are movement to contact, attack, exploitation, and pursuit. While it is convenient to talk of them as different tasks, in reality they flow readily from one to another.
        - There are three basic defensive tasks - area defense, mobile defense, and retrograde.

Question:

        I need to generate a single military course of action to accomplish the following mission objective:
        Move friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east via multiple bridges, destroy all hostile forces, and ultimately seize objective OBJ Lion East at the top right corner of the map (coordinates x: 200, y: 89).
        The mission is taking place in the following map/terrain:
        The map is split in two major portions (west and east sides) by a river that runs from north to south. There are four bridges that can be used to cross this river. Bridge names and exit coordinates are as follows: 1) Bridge Bobcat (x: 75, y: 26), 2) Bridge Wolf (x: 76, y: 128), 3) Bridge Bear (x:81, y: 179), and 4) Bridge Lion (x: 82, y: 211).
        The available Friendly and Hostile forces with their respective identification tags, types, and position are defined in the following JSON object:
        {'unit_id': 4295229441, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 82, 'y': 220}}, {'unit_id': 4296540161, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 85, 'y': 220}}, {'unit_id': 4297588737, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4297850881, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 226}}, {'unit_id': 4298113025, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 236}}, {'unit_id': 4298375169, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 86, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4298637313, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4298899457, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 78, 'y': 213}}, {'unit_id': 4299423745, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 32, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4300210177, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 80, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4300472321, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4301520897, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 83, 'y': 217}}, {'unit_id': 4302307329, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 36, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4302045185, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 237}}, {'unit_id': 4301783041, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 25, 'y': 224}}, {'unit_id': 4301258753, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 57, 'y': 234}}, {'unit_id': 4300996609, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 38, 'y': 240}}, {'unit_id': 4300734465, 'unit_type': 'Mechanized Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 33, 'y': 232}}, {'unit_id': 4299948033, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 34, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4299685889, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 84, 'y': 215}}, {'unit_id': 4299161601, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 40, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4297326593, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 227}}, {'unit_id': 4297064449, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 41, 'y': 230}}, {'unit_id': 4296802305, 'unit_type': 'Infantry', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 24, 'y': 229}}, {'unit_id': 4296278017, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 239}}, {'unit_id': 4296015873, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 35, 'y': 228}}, {'unit_id': 4295753729, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Hostile', 'position': {'x': 79, 'y': 219}}, {'unit_id': 4295491585, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 37, 'y': 238}}, {'unit_id': 4294967297, 'unit_type': 'Unknown', 'alliance': 'Friendly', 'position': {'x': 39, 'y': 228}}
        
Answer:
To generate a single military course of action to accomplish the mission objective, the following steps can be taken:

1. Initial Reconnaissance: Gather intelligence on the strength and locations of hostile forces, as well as key terrain features and potential obstacles along the designated routes.

2. Planning Phase: Create a plan that focuses on efficiently and effectively moving friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east, while simultaneously neutralizing hostile forces and seizing objective OBJ Lion East.

3. Bridge Utilization: Assess the condition of all four bridges (Bridge Bobcat, Bridge Wolf, Bridge Bear, and Bridge Lion) and prioritize their usage based on their condition, terrain advantages, and proximity to friendly forces. Determine which bridges are most suitable for crossing the river and establish control over them early in the operation.

4. Deployment of Forces: Assign appropriate units to clear and secure each bridge crossing, ensuring the safety and smooth movement of friendly forces. Coordinate with supporting assets such as armored vehicles, artillery, and air support to assist in the destruction of hostile forces.

5. Simultaneous Operations: Conduct coordinated operations at each bridge crossing, synchronizing the timing of engagements to achieve surprise and overwhelm enemy positions. Utilize combined arms tactics, combining infantry, mechanized infantry, and other combat assets to suppress and eliminate hostile forces.

6. River Crossing: Once the bridges are secured, initiate the movement of friendly forces across the river. Prioritize protecting the crossing points and ensure the safe passage of personnel and equipment.

7. Clearing Hostile Forces: As friendly forces progress eastward, identify and eliminate remaining hostile forces encountered throughout the terrain. Utilize reconnaissance and intelligence assets to pinpoint enemy positions and employ maneuver and firepower to neutralize hostile threats.

8. Objective Seizure: Coordinate with friendly forces to converge on objective OBJ Lion East at the top right corner of the map (coordinates x: 200, y: 89). Utilize overwhelming force and combined arms tactics to neutralize any remaining resistance and seize control of the objective.

9. Consolidation and Security: Establish defensive positions and consolidate control over the objective. Strengthen security measures to prevent any hostile counterattacks or infiltration attempts.

10. Maintenance and Resupply: Ensure friendly forces are properly resupplied with ammunition, fuel, and other necessary provisions. Conduct maintenance and repair activities to sustain combat effectiveness.

11. Post-Mission Analysis: Conduct a thorough assessment of the mission's success and identify any lessons learned for future operations. Analyze intelligence gathered during the mission to gather additional information on enemy capabilities and intentions.

By following these steps, a military course of action can be generated to successfully accomplish the mission objective of moving friendly forces from the west side of the river to the east, destroying all hostile forces, and seizing objective OBJ Lion East.
